## I baught a Motorcycle!

#### 18. Aug 2024.

Actually I baught it maybe even a month ago but just didn't write about it here. Anyway im writing now. It's a 2016 Yamaha WR 125 X, and It's Amazing!!! Not the fastest one but still soo much fun, it's so light and small, like a toy. I already did some mods, underbar mirrors, tailtidy and it looks sick now! Here are some pictures:
