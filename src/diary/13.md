## I'm back again

#### 30. Jul 2023.

I'm back again... Finally, everything is returning to normal. I finished renovating my house, work a bit less, and will go on an annual vacation next week. I'm finally getting back to having a little more free time.

I've finally started to go out with my friends more again. I went camping two weeks ago, and it was amazing. I will definitely do it again. Ah, much has happened since my last post, but I haven't been writing much...

I bought a new bike too, a YT Capra MX Core 1. It's insane how much better it is compared to my old nukeproof pulse. Im so happy with it, though I haven't ridden it much yet. I definitely will in the future.

The biggest, best, and most important news is that the middle school friend I was talking about in my last post is now my girlfriend :). I don't know what else to say; she's just so fucking cool, and Im so happy to have her in my life. Also, I had a crush on her when I was like 8-9 years old, so yeah, that's just insane to think about now that I'm 20.
