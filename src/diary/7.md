## It's Spring!

#### 25. March 2023.

Today is such a beautiful spring day, warm but not hot, just a little bit of clouds and no wind...

Literally perfect, so when I woke up in the morning I ate breakfast and went for a bike ride arround the town.

Really chill ride, nothing crazy, just a bit of bunny hopping on sidewalks doing whellies'n stuff like that. And riding arround a park that has really cool dirt trails with trees.
