## Senj

#### 16. Aug 2023.

Hmhm.. Yesterday I returned from my 3 day trip to Senj, I visited my grandma, who lives there. Though short, the trip was amazing.

I almost wasn't even using my phone. I went to the beach with a book instead of my phone, I only took it when I was on my bike just in case I fail a bunny hop and brake my leg or sm like that, so I can call for help :(... Didn't end up using it tho. Yeah, it was just so relaxing and chill. I realized that it's really not that hard to be outside without a phone. Yeah, sometimes you are like, ahh.. if only I had my phone to take a picture of this or look at a clock or sm like that, but I realized that it is really not that important to know exacly what time it is.. I'm on vacation after all and don't need to be connected with everyone all the time. Also, it makes you think; you see something interesting, enjoy it and remember it so you can talk about it later and not just take a picture and leave. It makes you rely on your memory and instincts instead of GPS and much more. It wasn't boring at all, I will definitely go out without my phone more often from now on. I dunno, it just makes you feel free.. It's literally more fun when you have nothing with you.. no need to worry about anything, just enjoing the moment. This sounds so generic and kind of stupid, I know... everyone is saying like _No phone = happy = enjoy moment'n shit like that_ BUT it really is TRUE.
