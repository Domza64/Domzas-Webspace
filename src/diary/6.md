## Rode My Tomos Today

#### 20. March 2023.

I "completed" my tomos with a friend two days ago. There is still so much to do; we have only just got it almost rideable. The few meters I drove in first gear to test it out because I hadn't even installed a clutch were so much fun.

btw, we started it by pushing it in neutral and then changing into first gear.

When I saw Tomos in my garage after I got home from work today, I had to take it out for a spin. The best decision I've ever made, man; even though I only did two loops around my street and shifted into second gear without a clutch (sorry Tomos, not going to do it again), I felt like I was going 100 km/h, it was so fast and so much fun. It essentially made this Monday the best day and provided me with enough joy to last the entire week. The strangest sentence, but sure, this was just so fun I am definitely going to keep riding motorcycles and I am planning to go get a motorcicle licence now.
