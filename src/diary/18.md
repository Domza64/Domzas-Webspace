## Finally I'm writing again!

#### 10. Jan 2023.

### Sooooo, Finally I'm back after a long time...

Anyway, I really wanted to write for the past few months, BUT... Ever since I migrated my site to a new VPS and added Spring Boot backend, articles weren't hardcoded in HTML anymore, they were stored in a database. And me being me, I didn't create UI, or endpoint for adding new articles and I definitely wasn't going to be manually creating and inserting articles in DB. So as fucking stupid as it is I literally just wasn't posting anything even though I wanted, because the only way was directly inserting data in a DB and ofc I was too lazy for that.

### How am I posting now?

Well, ofc I finally made admin page, and API endpoint so now I can finally write and post easely.

### Why did it take so long?

Hmmm, thing is I wasn't sure how to make authentication, I was considering many different approaches and I even made few demos, but never finished them... I was just experimenting, doing and redoing... And now finally I did it. I am using KeyCloak Oauth2 server for auth and reason for it is that I have much bigger plans for the future, I'll make a website that will also be using this Oauth2 server for auth. Won't talk about it much for now though.\n\nSo I think this is it for now, just a short update, because from now on I will hopefully be writing a lot more."
