Soo, I don't have much to write today, but I just wanted to write something...

The last few weeks have been a bit harsh, but it's gettin better.

Just going for a bike ride alone without anything but my bike is really nice, fuck.. Just riding.. no phone, no backpack, water, music, nothin... Just riding, jumping, chillin on the waterfront, lookin at the sunset... Something I'll fucking miss soo much one day... I'm soo happy that I can enjoy it now... I'm soooo fucking happy that I have my bike; sometimes it just makes the most boring commute insanely fun... Some depressing day? Just a quick ride can make you escape reality for a bit better than any movie, anime, alcohol or whatever... (I don't drink btw, but a lot of people use alcohol, drugs..., for this shit... though riding is just infinately better solution).

Anyway, this is a cute image of my girlfriend and me that she drew.
