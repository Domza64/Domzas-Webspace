## The Year 2025

#### 1. Jan 2025.

### Good bye 2024.

And It's already 2025, I don't have something specific to write about, but just wanted to write something. Anyway I'm happy with 2024., It was just an amazing year, I got my motorcycle licence, baught my first motorcycle, passed requred exam in Croatia to be able to enroll in collage, and succesfully enrolled in IT. Actually I spent a ton of time at work, but I quit at the end of november and have been enjoying collage since. I finally started working a lot more on my projects and even though results are not really visible yet hopefully I will have something cool to show soon...

Well time files, literally.. even though I'm only turning 22 this year, I just wanna go back to beeing 16 and doing stupid shit with no worries. Sice that is not possible my goals for 2025 are to just enjoy life more, work less; try to forget about the past and enjoy the present since one day I'll be remembering these moments wanting to go back, just like I'm doing right now... I guess I'll also try to get a summer job that is in IT field, that would be soo cool...
