## New website

#### 14. Oct 2023.

### Nothing relly new actually, at least on the frontend :)

So I started writing my website in Spring Boot and got a dedicated VPS for hosting. I am really tired today, I've been working almost an entiry day so I am not going to write much today. But in few days I will maybe write more about all this; subpages, current projects and this website... Might actually come back to Mystic Gemstones to actually release first alpha or someting like that. That's it for today.

ps.

I HATE SQL... actually I am getting a familiar with it slowly so its ok... I hated it so much when started using it; MongoDB ftw!
