## Python Tetris

#### 21. Mar 2025.

Recently I made a really cool game. I mean, just a tetris clone which is not even that good. But it was a really fun ~3 day project. Check it out: [here](https://github.com/Domza64/Python-Tetris). Yeah, as simple as it is it was just really fun and furfillyng to actually make it so I posted it.
