## My Tomos APN 4

#### 12. March 2023.

So, since I haven't posted about this here yet, here's a quick summary:

I bought this bike from my friend for super cheap, like 30 bucks or something, and it was so broken and in really bad shape. Everything was so rusted and stuff. I just wanted to restore it for fun, and since it is my first restoration project, I wanted something cheap and simple so I wouldn't have the fear of fucking something up, and this is as cheap and simple as a restoration project can be.

### So I started the restoration...

Firstly, I took everything apart to the smallest bolt, and then, part by part, I ground down the rust and put on new paint. BUT.. I didn't do that for every part. I fully restored some parts, including the body, rear shocks, fuel tank, and rear (things that hold the rear wheel), and then when time to slowly start putting it all together came, I realized that the front fork was bent beyond repair, so I had to get a new one. I couldn't find a good one on the used market for a while... until a month ago when I finally got one. And today I decided to temporarily give up on full, 100% perfect restoration and just put it together, even if it doesn't look perfect. I just couldn't wait any longer; I had to put it together for a test ride. It's not
ready for a test ride yet though; I need to put on the clutch and chain, and then I can finally test ride it for the very first time.

### Current progress:

Sooo, It is assembled and works; only most important parts though, except chain and clutch wire which are not installed yet. Rear breake and a lot more parts are missing. Also lot of parts are not restored yet. But I will definitely continue perfecting it; I will add all missing parts and restore and paint parts that are not currently restored.

### Summary:

For now, I will just have fun on this bike, and as time goes on, I will slowly keep fixing new issues as well as adding missing parts and restored parts that have not yet been restored. And I will definitely keep uploading progress here. Also forgive me for really bad writing of this it's really late; I just want to post this so I can go to sleep.

Thanks for reading :>
