## FIRST RACE!!!

#### 19. March 2023.

### Enduro Mali Bak

Awwww man...

It was absolutely incredible and I was soo bad; I finished last and crashed on the second stage, but for my first race and my first time riding in terrain like this (up until now, I have only ridden on the street and extremely easy beginner trails), I am super happy that I managed to complete all three stages. I will try my best to use experience gained from this race to advance in the next one since I know I can do much much better.

I can't wait to continue this amazing journey, so be sure to check back occasionally for new posts since there will undoubtedly be new posts about all sorts of strange things I do around here.

There is soo much more to write about this but today I am just not creative and don't know what to write so yeea... this is all.
