## Fire, Stickers and Spring Boot

#### 10. Sep 2023.

### What I've been doing...

I haven't been posting much, but I've been doing a lot.

Currently, I'm working on a secret project in Spring Boot; I can't talk about it yet, but potentially it could be a website with a lot of users that actually earns me some passive money. Anyway, besides that, I am learning Spring Boot since I am quite comfy with Java now. Also, I'd say I have a decent knowledge of HTML and CSS now and am starting to get familiar with Java Script. I still don't know much about databases, but that is something I am looking to learn in the future. Basically, I'll be familiar with Java and Spring Boot, as well as HTML, CSS, Java Script, SQL, and MongoDB, which is pretty cool.

Also, I started a project in Angular. Though I am not currently planning to learn Angular, I used this chance to get familiar with it and work on my Angular project together with my friend who has to make an Angular project for college. Basically, it's just a basic, not useful website. Its only purpose is for me to get familiar with Angular. Currently, the project is just an initialized github repo, but hopefully It will be something at the point that you are reading this.

### Forest fire

This happened on September 7, but I'm writing it now.

So basically, I was just riding my bike, like I usually do, and all of a sudden I entered a just-burned-down forest... I have no fucking idea how I didn't see it earlier but it was just like.. everything normal, and then just a straight line separating normal from burned down. The ground was still soo hot to touch but very wet, and I saw firefighters around 30 meters from me. It was just a feeling you can't describeâ€”I dunno, the smell, the wet but hot ground and the super straight line separating burned-down from not-burned-down.

This article is a mess lol. I was just randomly writing what came to my mind...

Images of custom sticker I made for my new bike... They just look amazing espettially in real life.

Also a part of burned down forest I saw.
