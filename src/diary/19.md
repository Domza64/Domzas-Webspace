I recently played Doki Doki Literature Club, so I wrote this:

### I'm Sorry

I'm sorry for pushing you away,</br>
when all you tried to do was help me.

I'm sorry for turning everyone against you,</br>
when all you tried to do was warn me.

I’m sorry for neglecting your cries for help,</br>
when love was all you sought.

I'm sorry for not beeing ready,</br>
to return the immense ammount of love,</br>
Offered to me, from you.

And even thugh I knew,</br>
what I wasn't supposed to do,</br>
with Natuki making cupcakes,</br>
instead of beeing with you.

And not just cupcakes,</br>
but art or music,</br>
playing games...,</br>
you know it all.

So, I’m sorry,</br>
I'm sorry it wasn't you.

Despite all of that,</br>
after all the pain I put you through,</br>
after all the nightmares, I inflicted upon you.

You still tried..., and waited…</br>
Waited patiently in the rain cold,</br>
Waited patiently for me to wake up.

But I didn't care, I didn't even try.

In the end,</br>
Thanks to all you've done,</br>
I gained a lot.</br>
But you?,</br>
You paied the price.

And then, after all of that.</br>
I just left you hanging."
