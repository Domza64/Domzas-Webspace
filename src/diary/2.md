## My First Graffiti

#### 26. February 2023.

Actually, it was not on this day that I drew it; it was February 18, 2023., but since this page didn't exist at that time, I am just posting it now.

Anyway, as I said, this is my first ever attempt at drawing on walls. I've painted with spray cans before, but I've never actually drawn on walls. Considering this, I am really proud and happy with how this turned out; obviously, it's not a great graffiti piece, but to me, it's amazing, and it was so much fun to make it. I just listened to loud music in an old abandoned building while spraying on walls; don't know why, but it's just so relaxing and fun that it makes you forget about reality and feel like a kid again.
