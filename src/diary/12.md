## Too Much Going On

#### 5. may 2023.

Ah man... I am fucking tierd, don't feel like doing anything anymore, not in a depressing way tho I am still really super happy, it's not that its hard, its just too much. Since my last post, I have hardly had any free time. I got a loan and I've been remodeling my house, I've been working longer hours because the summer season is approaching and there is a lot of work to be done. Though I didn't see my pals a much, I did manage to ride my bike a few times. Despite this, I am not complaining. Obviously, I haven't posted anything here because I've had neither the time nor the interesting storyes and stuff to write about.

But by far the best thing that has happened recently is that I've 'remet' a really fucking cool middleschool friend who I haven't seen in years so I can't not be happy no matter how many shit things happen and how hard life gets.
